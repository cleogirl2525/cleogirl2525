👋 Hi, I’m **SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY aka @cleogirl2525.** I'm an artist, a Steering Comittee Member for the Clinic for Open Source Arts, an Assistant Professor at a university in Virgina, and the Digital Developer and Technology Manager at the Black Lunch Table. 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to better manage projects, how to navigate and implement the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), and how to read tarot.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that support the longevity and legacies of black people, black art, and black life. 

📫 You can reach me at shawne.holloway@gmail.com or via any social media @ cleogirl2525. Hmu!
