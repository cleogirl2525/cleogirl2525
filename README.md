👋 Hi, I’m **SHAWNÉ MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY** I'm a performance artist, Assistant Professor of Kinetic Imaging at Virginia Commonwealth University, and the Digital Developer and Technology Manager at Black Lunch Table. 

🌱 I’m currently learning how to better manage projects and cultivating support for the developers I work with, how to navigate and implement the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), and how to read tarot.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that support the longevity and legacies of Black people, Black art, Black language, and Black life.
